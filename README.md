## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Ability to post and view reviews for songs
- Restriction on who can post reviews based on user role
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS

## Architecture

The application is divided into two main components:

1. **Backend (Node.js)**: Handles API requests, user authentication, and database interactions.
2. **Frontend (React & TypeScript)**: Provides user interface and handles presentation logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MySQL (for the database)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-review-app.git
   cd music-review-app
   ```

2. Set up the backend:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and configure your MySQL connection settings.

3. Set up the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the MySQL server.
2. Run the backend:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   node app.js
   ```

   The backend will be running on `http://localhost:3001`.

3. Run the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Notes

- Make sure to replace `yourusername` in the repository link with your actual GitHub username.
- You may want to adjust the API endpoints section based on your actual implementation, especially if you add more functionality.
- Consider updating specific installation steps based on your project’s requirements (e.g., environment variables you need to set).
- Customize the contributing section as necessary based on your preferred workflow for contributions (e.g., branching strategy, code reviews, etc.).
